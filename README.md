**DeepSafe** is a modular, high-performance, and containerized platform designed for the robust detection of deepfakes in digital media. By aggregating state-of-the-art detection models into a unified ensemble, DeepSafe provides enterprise-grade accuracy and reliability.

## 🚀 Why DeepSafe?

### Platform Agnostic & Dependency Isolated
DeepSafe adopts a **microservices architecture** where each detection model runs in its own isolated Docker container. This design choice is deliberate and critical:
-   **No Dependency Hell**: Each model can have its own specific version of PyTorch, CUDA, or other libraries without conflicting with others.
-   **Platform Independent**: Whether you are on Linux, macOS, or Windows, if you have Docker, DeepSafe works.
-   **Scalable**: Scale individual models based on load.

### Key Features
-   **Enterprise-Grade Authentication**: Secure Login and Registration system to protect access.
-   **Multi-Modal Detection**: Analyzes both **Images** and **Videos** for manipulation.
-   **Ensemble Intelligence**: Combines multiple state-of-the-art models (NPR, UniversalFakeDetect, CrossEfficientViT) for superior accuracy.
-   **Meta-Learning Engine**: Dynamically stacks model outputs using advanced meta-learners to reduce false positives.
-   **Premium UI/UX**: A modern, dark-themed React dashboard with interactive charts and real-time feedback.
-   **Dockerized Architecture**: Fully containerized services for easy deployment and isolation.
-   **RESTful API**: Robust FastAPI backend with health checks, batch processing, and detailed logging.

## 🏗️ Architecture

DeepSafe orchestrates a fleet of specialized detectors via a central API gateway:

graph TD
    Client[Web Client / User] --> Nginx[Nginx / Frontend]
    Nginx --> API[DeepSafe API (FastAPI)]
    API --> Meta[Meta-Learner / Ensemble]
    
    subgraph "Image Detectors"
        Meta --> NPR[NPR Deepfake]
        Meta --> UFD[Universal Fake Detect]
    end
    
    subgraph "Video Detectors"
        Meta --> CEV[Cross Efficient ViT]
    end
```

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
-   **Docker** & **Docker Compose**
-   **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepSafe.git
    cd DeepSafe
    ```

2.  **Launch the Platform**:
    ```bash
    make start
    ```
    *This will build all containers and start the services. Initial build may take a few minutes.*

3.  **Access the Dashboard**:
    Open `http://localhost:80` in your browser.

4.  **API Documentation**:
    Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the interactive Swagger UI.

## 📦 Available Models
